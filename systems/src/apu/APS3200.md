Curve fitted polynomial regression generation: http://polynomialregression.drque.net/online.php

Data points, based on a video by Komp with OAT of ~5 degrees. Note that OAT isn't yet part of the formula,
as we don't know the exact temperature effects on EGT yet (linear or not?). I also suspect there is an altitude
EGT effect (less air density causing higher EGT during start as it provides less cooling?), but that effect is also unknown.
